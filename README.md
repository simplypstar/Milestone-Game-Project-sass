# Milestone-Game-Project
 Online Web-based Sudoku Game

Had to replace the dash (-) in the id names with an underscore (_) to be comppatible with javascript
Configure the grids to have internals borders
Configured the grids to have alternating background colors
Configured the input fields background to change to yellow when selected; thanks to Christopher Marlowe
  for showing me that the field color had to be set to transparent before this would work
Configured input fields to change green for a correct entry and red for an incorrect entry
Added a function to enable blank field so they would be ready for input
Added a function to disable fields containing a number on a new game board
Added a function the verifies the player selected the correct number for a field
Added counters to check when all 81 input fields are filed; this indicated the end of the game
Added an applause3.mp3 file that plays when the board is completed
